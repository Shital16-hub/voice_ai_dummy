INTEGRATION EXAMPLES

CRM Integration

Salesforce Integration
Integrate voice AI with Salesforce to automatically log customer interactions and update records.

Configuration Steps:
1. Create connected app in Salesforce with OAuth 2.0
2. Configure webhook endpoints in voice AI dashboard
3. Map conversation data to Salesforce fields
4. Set up real-time sync for contact updates

Code Example (Python):
```python
import requests

def update_salesforce_contact(contact_id, conversation_summary):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {sf_access_token}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    data = {
        'Last_Conversation__c': conversation_summary,
        'Last_Contact_Date__c': datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    response = requests.patch(
        f'{sf_instance_url}/services/data/v52.0/sobjects/Contact/{contact_id}',
        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )
    
    return response.status_code == 200
```

Phone System Integration

Asterisk PBX Integration
Connect voice AI to Asterisk PBX for automated call handling.

Configuration Requirements:
- Asterisk version 16.0 or higher
- SIP trunk configuration with authentication
- Dialplan modifications for AI routing
- AGI script for voice AI communication

Sample Dialplan:
```
[incoming-ai]
exten => _X.,1,Answer()
same => n,Set(CHANNEL(language)=en)
same => n,AGI(voiceai-connector.py,${CALLERID(num)})
same => n,Hangup()
```

The AGI script handles the communication between Asterisk and the voice AI service, managing audio streaming and response routing.

Microsoft Teams Integration
Enable voice AI within Microsoft Teams for internal support and assistance.

Setup Process:
1. Register application in Azure AD
2. Configure bot framework endpoints
3. Deploy Teams app package
4. Configure permissions for voice access

Custom Integration
For custom applications, use our WebSocket API for real-time voice streaming.

WebSocket Endpoint: wss://api.voiceai.company.com/v1/stream

Connection requires authentication token and supports bidirectional audio streaming with real-time transcription and response generation.
