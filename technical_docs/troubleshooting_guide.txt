TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

Common Issues and Solutions

Audio Quality Problems

Poor Recognition Accuracy
If speech recognition accuracy is below 90%, check the following:
- Ensure microphone input level is between -12dB and -6dB
- Minimize background noise in the environment
- Verify network bandwidth meets minimum requirements (256 kbps)
- Check for audio codec compatibility issues

Choppy or Distorted Audio
Audio distortion typically indicates network or processing issues:
- Test network latency (should be under 150ms)
- Verify CPU usage is below 80% on client devices
- Check for firewall blocking UDP traffic on ports 3478-3479
- Ensure adequate bandwidth allocation for real-time audio

Connection Issues

Authentication Failures
Authentication problems usually involve API key configuration:
- Verify API key is correctly copied without extra spaces
- Check API key permissions in the dashboard
- Ensure API key hasn't expired (keys expire every 12 months)
- Confirm your IP address is whitelisted if IP restrictions are enabled

Timeout Errors
Connection timeouts may indicate network or server issues:
- Standard timeout is 30 seconds for API requests
- Check your internet connection stability
- Verify our service status at status.voiceai.company.com
- Try reducing request payload size if sending large audio files

Performance Optimization

Reducing Latency
To achieve sub-2-second response times:
- Use nearest geographic endpoint (US, EU, or APAC)
- Implement connection pooling to avoid handshake overhead
- Cache frequently accessed data locally
- Use streaming audio instead of batch processing

Scaling for High Volume
For handling 1000+ concurrent conversations:
- Implement proper load balancing across multiple instances
- Use Redis for session state management
- Enable horizontal auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- Consider dedicated infrastructure for enterprise volume
