SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Infrastructure Components

Load Balancer
High-availability load balancers distribute traffic across multiple application servers. Supports automatic failover and geographic distribution for optimal performance.

Application Servers
Containerized microservices architecture running on Kubernetes. Each service handles specific functionality:
- Voice Processing Service: Handles STT and TTS operations
- AI Reasoning Service: Manages LLM interactions and context
- Session Management Service: Maintains conversation state
- Integration Service: Handles external API connections

Database Architecture
Multi-tier database architecture ensures scalability and reliability:
- Redis: Session state and real-time caching
- PostgreSQL: User data and configuration storage  
- Vector Database: Knowledge base embeddings and similarity search
- Time-series DB: Analytics and performance metrics

Security Implementation
Enterprise-grade security across all system layers:
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all communications
- OAuth 2.0 and SAML for authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

Monitoring and Observability
Comprehensive monitoring ensures system reliability:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Automated alerting for anomalies
- 24/7 NOC monitoring

Disaster Recovery
Robust disaster recovery ensures business continuity:
- Multi-region deployment with automatic failover
- Real-time data replication
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 15 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 5 minutes
